# Quantum Implementation of Conway's Game of Life

Emmett Shear asked:

```Has anyone made Conwayâ€™s Game Of Life, but the values of the cells are in [-1, 1, -i, i] instead of [0, 1] and the evolution rules per time step are complex instead? Quantum Life.```

This is my attempt at answering that question.
